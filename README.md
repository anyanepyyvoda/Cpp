# Wall-E's Quest for the Last Plant

This project is a 2D platform game developed in C++ using the SGG graphics library. The objective is to control Wall-E, collect recyclable items, avoid toxic garbage, and retrieve the last plant on Earth to deliver it to Eve. The game features two levels, a scoring system, sound effects, and background music.

## Features

- Platform-style movement and level progression
- Collision detection with obstacles and collectibles
- Scoring system based on recyclable garbage collected
- Victory condition based on retrieving the plant and reaching Eve
- Basic physics simulation (jumping, gravity)
- Two distinct game levels
- Background music and sound effects

## Setup Instructions

This project depends on the SGG graphics library, which was provided by the course instructor. The library is not included in the repository.

To build and run the project:

1. Obtain the SGG graphics library from the official course resources or instructor.
2. Place the `sgg` folder in the root directory of the project or configure the include/library paths accordingly.
3. Compile the project using a C++17-compatible compiler and link it with the SGG graphics library.
